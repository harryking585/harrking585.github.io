                <div class="About Me">
                I'm currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Math at Texas Tech University.<br>
                Here's a little sneak peak into what I've been working on and what I enjoy<br>
                doing in my freetime along with some side projects that I'd love for you to explore.

                <div class="Web Description">
                <h4>Why did I make this website?</h4>
                For a little background I was never able to experience delving into the more frontend oriented <br>
                languages as much as I would have liked during my studies at Texas Tech, so I took it upon<br>
                myself to learn 3 new languages in aims to sharpen my skills in this expertise. Overall I had an<br>
                amazing time making this website and learning a whole 3 new languages in the process<br>
                was just a plus on the journey to creating what you're looking at now!<br>
